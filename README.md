# TriviaTime

An online Trivia game with selectable difficulty. It includes multiple and true or false question.
Play it on your phone or desktop.

## Technology

This project was created with the use of the [React](https://reactjs.org/) JavaScript library. It uses only functional components and hooks for its functionality. The web application is a Single Page Application (SPA) and uses [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for the client side navigation. The project has a global state management system that uses the React Context API. All of the data is provided by the open and free [Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). Its Session Token system is used for managing the non-repetition of questions.

## Styling

The design was provided by the client and I attempted to reproduce it with the utmost precision. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) were used for fonts and icons.

## Project use

First clone or download the code from this [repository](https://github.com/Shizuri/react-trivia-game).
Once cloned to your local system run `npm install` so that NPM can pull all the required data.
Once it's finished run `npm start` to start the project. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
